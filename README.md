# disease-detection

Deep learning project for detection of Alzheimer's disease based on 4 classes using MRI Scans using CNN
The dataset used in the project is from kaggle.

I have built a cnn model to detect the presence of dementia in a patient's MRI Scans. The accuracy the model achieved was 93.75% and data loss was seen to be 22.17%

Then I have saved the model in h5 file format and the loaded it in a streamlit app to make the model accesible to users.

After submitting your details the web app generates a pdf report using fpdf and your data gets stored in a mysql database
